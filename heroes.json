Hi folks! Looking forward to seeing you all soon. I have hit some traffic, so should be there at 2:10. We will start off with check-ins with me today and then move to C&I and end with our speaker.

Mike [5:22 PM]
I'm in what looks to be an hour of traffic on 95. So sorry guys, be there as soon as I can.

Peggy Yu [5:22 PM]
Traffic is the worst! Good luck! Thatâ€™s dedication, @Mike!
